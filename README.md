# Qtile-config
This is my qtile rice for ubuntu.

Requirements:
- picom (compositor)
- dunst (notifications)
- rofi  (application launcher)
- thunar (file manager)
- xfce4-power-manager
- feh (wallpaper)

This rice is heavily based off of the Adapta-Nokto Gtk theme, so you should probably install that too.
I also took a lot of inspiration for the bar from [axyl-os/axyl-qtile.](https://github.com/axyl-os/axyl-qtile)

This rice is just clean and simple, I don't like too much colors on my screen.
