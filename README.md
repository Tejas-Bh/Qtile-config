# Qtile-config
This is my qtile rice for ubuntu.

Requirements:
- compton (picom on arch)
- dunst
- rofi
- thunar
- xfce4-power-manager

This rice is heavily based off of the Adapta-Nokto Gtk theme, so you should probably install that too.
I also took a lot of inspiration for the bar from [axyl-os/axyl-qtile.](https://github.com/axyl-os/axyl-qtile)
